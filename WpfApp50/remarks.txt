remarks for your db design 

postal_code: do not contains the code given from the Rashut Hdoar.

date: why do you need this table, there is a special field type for this in SQL.

list_products: you already have products table and sins it is a table then it is a list, can contain a lot of rows. so you should delete this table.

order: you forgot to add a foreign key (FK) of employee , the person that actually perform the order.

** you do not address the client issue in case of delivery, fetch phone and address into "notes" might not be good enough. i suggest a client table that contains name, phone address, etc. but the user must enter only name to move next. 

** what about the suppliers, you sell all kind of stuff, you need to buy it first.


Yofi keep the good work.
